Apache JMeter
Apache JMeter is an open-source software testing tool designed to load test functional behavior and measure performance. 
It is mainly used for performance testing of web applications but can also be used for other test functions. 
JMeter can simulate a heavy load on servers, networks, or objects to test their strength or to analyze overall performance under different load types.

Features
Load Testing: Simulate heavy loads on web servers, databases, and networks to test performance and scalability.
Functional Testing: Test the functional behavior of web applications by sending HTTP requests and analyzing responses.
Protocol Support: Supports testing of various protocols including HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, JDBC, LDAP, SOAP, JMS, TCP, and more.
Distributed Testing: Allows distributed testing for simulating high loads from multiple machines.
Plugins: Extensible with plugins to enhance functionality and support additional protocols.
Reporting: Generates comprehensive test reports in various formats including CSV, XML, and HTML.

Installation
Download JMeter: Download the latest version of Apache JMeter from the official website.
Extract Files: Extract the downloaded archive to a directory on your local machine.
Run JMeter: Navigate to the bin directory and run the jmeter executable file (or jmeter.bat on Windows).

Getting Started
Create a Test Plan: Start by creating a test plan which defines the steps to be executed during the test.
Add Thread Groups: Add one or more thread groups to simulate users or virtual users accessing the application.
Configure Samplers: Configure samplers to send requests to the server such as HTTP Request, JDBC Request, etc.
Add Listeners: Add listeners to capture and view test results such as View Results Tree, Summary Report, etc.
Run Test: Execute the test plan and monitor performance metrics and results.
